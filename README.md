# What we are going to learn today?

gitignore 
- By default, each and every folder is under git tracking.
- To indicate git, that certain files/folders need not be tracked, we need to use gitignore
- To create ignore files, we need to create a file named ".gitignore" without any file extension 
- Why to ignore files/folders? To avoid tracking of temporary files/folders that can be regenerated.
